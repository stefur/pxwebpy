`pxwebpy` is a Python client for the PxWeb API. The goal is to make it easier to get data from the API and into a dataframe. It is *BYODF*\* so that you can use what DataFrame library you prefer, be it `polars`, `pandas` or a `pyarrow` table.

<small>\* = *Bring your own dataframe*</small>

## Installation
The package is on PyPI and the easiest way to install it into your environment is:

```bash
pip install pxwebpy
```

Or by using `uv`:

```bash
uv add pxwebpy
```

## Usage
```{python}
# | eval: true
from pxweb import PxApi
import polars as pl

api = PxApi("scb")

# Swedish population per year
data = api.get_table_data(
    table_id="TAB5890",
    value_codes={"Tid": ["2022", "2023", "2024"], "ContentsCode": "0000053A"},
)

pl.DataFrame(data)
```
